When I'm not unraveling the mysteries of \( \mathbb{R}^n \) or navigating the elegance of **complex fields**, I’m busy transforming intricate equations into elegant solutions. Driven by a passion for harnessing the power of mathematics, I thrive on solving the toughest puzzles, turning chaos into clarity. Ready to tackle the unsolvable? Let’s crunch numbers and make the impossible possible!

## The Black-Scholes Formula

The Black-Scholes formula for a European call option is given by:

$$
C = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
$$

where

$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{S_0}{K}\right) + \left(r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}
$$

$$
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
$$
